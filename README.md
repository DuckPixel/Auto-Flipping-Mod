# Auction House Flipping Mod
This auto flipping mod is created and maintained by Michael, i have full ownership over this project and if the project at any point seemingly comes out of hand i will have to take down the project. I created this project in the legitiamcy of the community to show everyone that creating faulty modules and "ratting" peoples personal minecraft accounts and information is incredibly nieve, ignorant and stupid, people having asked me day in day out to make a proper flipping mod that wont steal your information because many people have been doing this now.

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION
I first created this mod for my personal usage as me and my friend found it hard to flip through the auction house i spent hours upon hours, scowering for decent flips, when we find them incredibly experienced people instantly buy out the item on the auction house those, who understood what they were doing. So i took matters in my own hands and created an affluent working module that every user can use! it's very user friendly interface custom programmed for the community can easily be used by anyone i have recieved alot of credit in the past for making other modules, mostly payed but i prefer making something that everyone can use unconditionally and it not costing a dime!
